# Mandatory fully qualified reference to the source image to be modified
source_image:

# String to be appended after the tag to indicate this is a modified version of
# the source image. Defaults to the output of the command
# "date +-modified-%Y%m%d%H%M%S"
modified_append_tag:

# If set, the modified image will be tagged with this reference. If the purpose
# of the image is not changing, it may be enough to rely on modified_append_tag
# to identify that this is a modified version of the source image.
# modified_append_tag will still be appended to this reference.
